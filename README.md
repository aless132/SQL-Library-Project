# SQL-Library-Project

In this project I created a library of 50 books, 20 users and 5 branches.  After setting up the database, I wanted to see how well SQL worked by quering for various books, by various authors and the different libraries.  I did several different queries, each with increasing complexity.  This was a difficult program for me to write but ultimately very reqarding.
